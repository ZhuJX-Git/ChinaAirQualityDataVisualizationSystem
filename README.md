# China Air Quality Data Visualization System
Based on the national air quality data provided by the China National Urban Air Quality Real-time Publishing Platform from 2014 to 2020, this data visualization system was designed. In addition to providing simple air quality information query, users can also filter and search data from multiple dimensions such as time, geography, etc. The query results can be displayed in the form of charts for further data analysis.
